				Water use and streamflow are highly sensitive to multiple climate extremes, which frequently lead to devastating impacts on natural ecosystems and human society. 
				For instance, co-occurrence of extreme precipitation and wind can result in massive infrastructural damage. 
				Combined drought and heat can lead to widespread forest mortality, and extreme wildfire, as recently experienced along the US west coast. 
				In this project we examine ecological responses to compound and sequential extreme events, and the resulting impact on coastal water resources,

				<p>Limits on ecosystem productivity due to water availability manifest through constraints on the amount of biomass that can be sustained, 
				and on the amount of photosynthesis that can be maintained. These constraints are most evident in the world’s warm and arid environments, 
				where water plays the dominant role in primary production and where foliage cover, plant water use, and photosynthesis are all tightly coupled. 
				They are also evident in the world’s cold regions, however, where freeze-thaw states dictate landscape hydrology and water availability. 
				The consequences of changes in water availability on global ecosystems are thus potentially dramatic. 
				Understanding both the current constraint of water availability on ecosystem function, and the consequences of likely future changes, is therefore an urgent need -
				one that we aim to address.

				<p>Flash droughts come on seemingly without warning, and sometimes with devastating effects. 
				Another distinguishing feature of flash droughts is that they are largely driven by evaporative demand. 
				This has implications for the dynamics and predictability of flash droughts in a changing climate. 
				It also suggests that understanding and prediction of flash droughts is inherently linked to understanding and prediction of high evaporative demand periods, 
				including heat extremes that persist for several days to weeks. 
				In this NSF PREEVENTS project, we are working to advance the understanding and subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction of flash droughts and their associated heat extremes.
				At Berkeley, we are developing machine-learning based estimates of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and respiration at high resolution, 
				in combination with remotely sensed estimates of evaporative stress, to define and characterize flash drought events.
